/*

It first creates a `PARTITIONED` Common Table Expression (CTE) that groups records by
`hacker_id` in the `Challenges` table and counts how many challenges each hacker has
completed (`count_chal`). Using a `ROW_NUMBER()` function within `PARTITIONED`, it assigns
a unique row number (`rown`) to each hacker in each `count_chal` group, which helps
identify hackers with a unique completion count.

The main query then joins the `Hackers` table with `PARTITIONED`, allowing access to
each hackerâ€™s `hacker_id`, `name`, and `count_chal`. A `WHERE` filter then selects only
those hackers who either completed the highest number of challenges or have a unique
`count_chal` (i.e., no other hacker shares that count).

Finally, the results are ordered by `count_chal` in descending order and by `hacker_id`
in ascending order for any ties in `count_chal`. This ensures the output highlights
the most active and uniquely accomplished hackers.
